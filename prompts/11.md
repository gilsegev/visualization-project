"Implement the foundational InfographicStrategy and register it in the ImageStrategyFactory.

    Blueprint Interface: Define a TypeScript interface InfographicBlueprint following the framework: narrativeType (journey, hub, stack, etc.), elements[] (title, detail, keyword), and tone.

    Router Intelligence: Update the ImageRouterService to detect 'infographic' requests from raw text.

    Blueprint Generation: Implement the logic to call the LLM (DeepSeek-V3/Gemini) to output a strict JSON blueprint. The LLM must characterize the content's meaning (e.g., 'this is a 4-step progression') rather than its visual layout.

    Mock Selection: For now, implement a stub selectTemplate() method that simply returns a placeholder string."
