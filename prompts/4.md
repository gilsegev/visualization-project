Goal: Hit your "50 images in 3 minutes" requirement.

    Instruction for Agent:
    "Create the final ImageOrchestratorService.

        It should take a raw course description, call the ImageRouterService to get the tasks, and then use the ImageStrategyFactory to execute them.

        CRITICAL: Use the p-limit library to process tasks with a concurrency of 10.

        Wrap the execution in a timer and log: 'Generated X images in Y seconds'.

        Expose this via a POST /debug/generate-course endpoint in a new ImageController."

    How this will be validated: 
✅ Validation Checkpoint

    The Stress Test: Use Postman or Swagger to send a prompt that would result in 10+ images.

    The Metric: Check the logs. Even with mocks, the overhead of the router and logic should be minimal. This ensures that when we plug in the real APIs (SiliconFlow, etc.) later, the infrastructure is ready to handle the speed.
