Goal: Finalize the Hybrid Engine by fixing the "stark white" background, correcting layer Z-indexing, and ensuring a full-bleed 1024x1024 render.

Task Instructions:

    Atmospheric Background Engine:

        Update InfographicStrategy to perform one additional, concurrent Silicon Flow request for a background.

        Prompt Logic: Take the blueprint.global_style_prompt and append: ", abstract minimalist background texture, out of focus, extremely soft lighting, no objects, harmonious with theme colors."

        Injection: Inject this Base64 result into the <image id="background_layer"> element. Ensure it is the first element inside the <svg> tag (Layer 0).

    Layer Z-Index Correction:

        In renderComposition, reorder the SVG DOM. The connector_layer (orange lines) must be moved so it is rendered behind the step_groups (the circles and text).

        Technical Fix: Place the connector <path> elements immediately after the background layer in the XML sequence.

    Full-Frame Scaling:

        Set the root <svg> attributes to width="100%" and height="100%".

        Apply preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice" to the root <svg> and the #background_layer image to ensure a full-bleed, edge-to-edge look without white borders.

        Ensure the Playwright screenshot viewport is set to exactly 1024x1024.

    Text Contrast & Depth:

        Add a subtle filter="url(#soft-shadow)" to the step_groups.

        If the background makes text hard to read, programmatically inject a semi-transparent rect (Glassmorphism effect) behind the #slot_txt_n elements to act as a text anchor.

How this will be validated:

    Test Case: "A 5-step horizontal journey of a startup: Idea, Funding, Build, Launch, Scale."

    Verification 1: The final PNG must have a thematic AI-generated background (e.g., blurred office or abstract tech texture) instead of white space.

    Verification 2: The connecting orange lines must pass underneath the step circles.

    Verification 3: The image must fill the entire 1024x1024 frame with no margins or scaling issues.

    Verification 4: Total E2E time must remain under the 10-second threshold.

To ensure the scaling is 100% accurate, you should also verify that the viewBox in the SVG template matches the aspect ratio of the final output. If the template is 620x1580 but the render is 1024x1024, the "Art Director" must either adjust the viewBox dynamically or select a template that fits the target aspect ratio.
