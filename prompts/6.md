Prompt 6: The Visual Artist (SiliconFlow Integration)

This prompt instructs the agent to replace the mock in VisualConceptStrategy with a real API call to SiliconFlow.

    Instruction for Agent:
    "Replace the mock logic in VisualConceptStrategy with a real image generation pipeline using the SiliconFlow API.

        Model Selection: Use the black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell model for the best balance of speed and quality.

        API Integration:

            Use the axios or node-fetch library to send a POST request to https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/images/generations.

            Use the refined_prompt from the task as the prompt.

            Set the image size to 1024x1024.

        Local Storage:

            The API will return a URL or a Base64 string. Pass this to our existing LocalStorageService.

            Store the resulting file as task-{index}-visual_concept.png.

        Error Handling: If the API fails (e.g., rate limit or invalid key), throw a descriptive error so the ImageOrchestratorService can mark it as 'rejected'.

        Environment Variable: Ensure the API key is read from SILICONFLOW_API_KEY in the .env file."

3. How This Will Be Validated

You will use your numbered verification system to confirm that the AI actually "understood" the request and that the parallel machinery handles both charts and photos simultaneously.
The Mixed Stress Test

Send a POST to /generate with:
"I need a professional illustration of a futuristic laboratory and a bar chart showing the growth of laboratory equipment sales."
