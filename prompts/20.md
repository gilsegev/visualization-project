Goal: Perform a full end-to-end validation of the Hybrid Infographic Engine using the "Honeybee Lifecycle" scenario.

Context: We are using the updated snake_process.svg template which contains 5 explicit image and text slots (slot_img_1-5, slot_txt_1-5).

Task Instructions:

    Refine the Art Director (Gemini 2.0 Flash):

        Update the system prompt in generateBlueprint to specifically request a "National Geographic Style Macro Photography" or "3D Scientific Illustration" aesthetic for this test.

        Constraint: The global_style_prompt must emphasize a "soft blurred background" or "pure white background" to ensure the subject pops within the circular mask.

    Asset Verification:

        Ensure the template provided in the previous turn is saved as public/assets/infographics/templates/snake_process.svg.

    The Test Run:

        Create a new test script test-ultimate-harmony.ts.

        Target Prompt: "Create a sequential infographic showing the life cycle of a honeybee: 1. Egg, 2. Larva, 3. Pupa, 4. Adult Bee, 5. Pollinating a Flower."

    Logging & Audit:

        Log the global_style_prompt generated by Gemini.

        Log the duration of the Silicon Flow parallel generation.

        Save the final result as honeybee-lifecycle.png.

How it will be validated:

    Visually inspect the final PNG.

    Success Criteria:

        Quantity: Exactly 5 images must appear in the winding snake path.

        Cohesion: The "Egg" and the "Adult Bee" must look like they belong in the same set (same lighting, same texture).

        Layout: The text "Egg," "Larva," etc., must be correctly positioned next to their respective circles.

        Integrity: No "404/broken" image icons should be visible.
