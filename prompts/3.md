Goal: Implement the "How" – connecting the decisions to actual execution.
Now that the ImageRouterService is working, please implement the Strategy Factory and Mock Workers:

        Create ImageStrategyFactory: Implement a service that maintains a map of all image strategies. It must have a getStrategy(type: string) method that returns the correct class instance (e.g., if the router says 'data_viz', the factory returns the DataVizStrategy).

        Implement 4 Concrete Strategies: Create VisualConceptStrategy, DataVizStrategy, MathFormulaStrategy, and BeautifySlideStrategy.

            Each must extend the BaseImageStrategy and implement performGeneration.

            For now, return a placeholder: https://placehold.co/1024x1024?text=MOCK_[TYPE]_IMAGE.

        Update ImageModule: Register the factory and all four strategies as providers.

        Create ImageController: Add a POST /generate endpoint. It should:

            Accept a raw string (e.g., 'Create a sales chart').

            Call ImageRouterService.classify() to get the tasks.

            For each task, use the ImageStrategyFactory to call .generate().

            Return the final list of mock URLs and task IDs."in NestJS."

    How this will be validated:
✅ Validation Checkpoint

[ ]Send Request: POST /generate with body {"content": "A photo of a forest and a bar chart of tree heights"}.
    
[ ]Check Response: You should get an array of two mock URLs.

[ ]Check Logs: Look for the following sequence:

    [ImageRouterService] Classifying content...

    [VisualConceptStrategy] Starting generation for task...

    [DataVizStrategy] Starting generation for task...
