Goal: Implement the "How" – connecting the decisions to actual execution.

    Instruction for Agent:
    "Now implement the Strategy Pattern for routing:

        Create a ImageStrategyFactory that holds an array of ImageGeneratorStrategy.

        Implement a method getStrategy(type: TaskType): ImageGeneratorStrategy.

        Create 'Mock' versions of the four strategies (Flux, VisActor, MathJax, NanoBanana). For now, have each mock just return a placeholder URL like https://placehold.co/1024x1024?text=Type_Name.

        Update the ImageModule to provide these strategies using the MULTI: true provider pattern in NestJS."

    How this will be validated:
✅ Validation Checkpoint

    The Test: Call the factory in a controller with type: 'data_viz'.

    Expected Result: It should return the MockDataVizStrategy instance.
