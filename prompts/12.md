Goal: Build the engine that matches the LLM's "Blueprint" to your specific SVG "Scenes."

    Asset Structure: Create the folder public/assets/infographics/templates/.

    The Template Library: Add your three SVG files to this folder:

        journey.svg (3–7 steps)

        hub.svg (One core + satellites)

        stack.svg (Clear vertical dependency)

        Note: Ensure these SVGs use standard IDs like id="title_n" and id="desc_n" for the slots.

    Deterministic Registry: Create a templates.json file that maps the narrativeType from the LLM Blueprint to these files:

        narrativeType: "journey" → journey.svg

        narrativeType: "hub" → hub.svg

        narrativeType: "stack" → stack.svg

    Selection Logic: Replace the stub in InfographicStrategy with a selectTemplate() method. It must:

        Validate that the elementCount in the blueprint fits the chosen template (e.g., if a Journey has 10 steps but the template only has 7 slots, log a warning or truncate).

        Return the file path of the selected SVG.

How it will be validated:

    Create a test case where the LLM identifies a "Hub" structure. Verify via console logs that InfographicStrategy correctly selects hub.svg from the registry.
