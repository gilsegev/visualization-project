"Replace the mock logic in DataVizStrategy with a real VisActor rendering pipeline and implement a local storage service.

        Rendering Engine (Playwright):

            Install and configure Playwright to run a headless browser instance within the DataVizStrategy.

            The strategy must inject a simple HTML template into the browser that loads the VisActor library via CDN.

            Use the payload.chartType and payload.data from the ImageTask to initialize a VChart instance.

            Capture a 1024x1024 screenshot of the chart container once the render is complete.

        Local Storage Service:

            Create a LocalStorageService with an upload(buffer: Buffer, fileName: string): Promise<string> method.

            Store images in a public/generated-images/ directory within the project root.

            Ensure this directory is served as a static asset so the app returns accessible local URLs (e.g., http://localhost:3000/generated-images/...).

        Prompt & Image Association:

            The ImageOrchestratorService must be updated to track the index of each task in the batch.

            The generated filename must follow the format: task-{number}-{type}.png (where {number} is the sequence index starting from 1).

            The final response from the POST /generate endpoint must explicitly return the refined_prompt alongside its corresponding numbered image URL.

        Performance Check: Re-use the Playwright browser context where possible to ensure each chart generation stays under 5 seconds."

How This Will Be Validated:

To verify the validity and association of your images, follow this testing protocol:
1. The Stress Test Request

Send a POST request to /generate with a content string containing multiple chart requests:
JSON

{
  "content": "Create three charts for my business course: 1. A bar chart of Q1 sales showing $10k, $15k, and $30k. 2. A line chart showing user growth over 5 years. 3. A pie chart of market share for three competitors."
}

2. Visual Verification Table

The API response will now include a numbered list. You can validate the results using this mapping:
Task #	Refined Prompt (From API)	Expected Visual Output	Local File Path
1	"Bar chart showing Q1 sales..."	A 1024x1024 Bar Chart with 3 bars.	public/generated-images/task-1-data_viz.png
2	"Line chart visualizing 5-year growth..."	A 1024x1024 Line Chart.	public/generated-images/task-2-data_viz.png
3	"Pie chart showing market share..."	A 1024x1024 Pie Chart.	public/generated-images/task-3-data_viz.png
