Goal: Implement the SVG Composition layer to populate the template with real content and handle dynamic text fitting.

    DOM Integration: Use jsdom within InfographicStrategy to load the selected SVG template into a virtual document for manipulation.

    Content Injection:

        Map infographic.content.items[i].title to id="title_i+1".

        Map infographic.content.items[i].detail to id="desc_i+1".

        Map the main infographic.content.title and subtitle to their respective template IDs.

    Smart Text Wrapping (D3 Utility):

        Integrate D3.js (loaded locally) to measure text widths based on the template's coordinate system.

        Implement a utility that converts long "detail" strings into multi-line SVG <text> blocks using <tspan> elements.

        Constraint: Text must wrap based on the template's designated box width. If it still exceeds height limits after wrapping, implement a "shrink-to-fit" font-size reduction.

    Dynamic Icon Embedding:

        For each icon_keyword, fetch a matching icon from public/assets/icons/.

        Use the injector to embed the SVG path data from the icon into the template’s <g id="icon_i+1"> placeholders.

    Emphasis Application: For any item with emphasis: "highlight", add the CSS class highlighted-node to that element's group in the DOM.

How it will be validated:

    Provide a request with a very long description for one of the steps.

    Verification: Inspect the generated SVG string. It must contain multiple <tspan> tags for the long description, and the icon_n groups must no longer be empty—they should contain path data from your local icon library.
