Goal: Transform the raw template into a populated infographic with wrapped text and icons.

    DOM Manipulation: Integrate jsdom into InfographicStrategy to load the template SVG into a virtual DOM.

    Smart Text Fitting:

        Use D3.js (loaded locally) to measure text widths.

        Implement a utility to wrap text into <tspan> blocks.

        Emphasis Hook: If an item has emphasis: "highlight", add the CSS class highlighted-step to that element's group in the DOM.

    Icon Injection: Match the icon_keyword to a local SVG in public/assets/icons/ and embed its path data into the icon_n slot.

How it will be validated:

    Inspect a generated SVG string. Verify it contains <tspan> tags for multi-line text and that "highlighted" items have the correct CSS class added.
