Goal: Establish the ground rules and data structures so everyone speaks the same language.

    Instruction for Agent:
    "I am building an image generation system in NestJS. First, please create a directory src/image-gen. In this directory, define:

        A Zod schema using nestjs-zod for an ImageTask. It must include id (uuid), type (enum: visual_concept, data_viz, math_formula, beautify_slide), refined_prompt (string), and payload (a JSON record for model-specific data).

        A TypeScript interface ImageGeneratorStrategy with a method generate(task: ImageTask): Promise<string>.

        An abstract BaseImageStrategy that implements the interface and includes basic logging for start/end times."

        how this will be validated: 
        ✅ Validation Checkpoint
    [ ] Does the code compile without errors?
    [ ] Can you see the ImageTask schema in your project?
