Goal: Apply the "NotebookLM" aesthetic using the visual_hints from the blueprint to inject curated styles and textural filters.

    Palette Mapping: Create a palettes.ts utility that maps the blueprint's visual_hints.mood (neutral, calm, energetic, serious) to specific color sets. Each set should define --primary, --secondary, --accent, and --text-color CSS variables.

    CSS Injection: Update the InfographicStrategy to inject these CSS variables into the root <svg> element during the composition phase. Ensure the SVG templates are updated to use these variables (e.g., fill="var(--primary)").

    The "Paper" Filter:

        Inject a global SVG <filter> into the composed SVG that provides a subtle "grain" and "paper texture" effect.

        Apply this filter to the background layer of the template to remove the "flat digital" look.

    Hand-Drawn Jitter (Rough.js):

        Integrate Rough.js logic to add a subtle hand-drawn jitter to specific paths, such as the connector arrows in the journey archetype or the outlines of "highlighted" nodes.

        Use the emphasis: "highlight" field to trigger thicker stroke weights or brighter accent colors for specific items.

    Density Handling: If visual_hints.density is "airy", programmatically adjust the SVG's viewBox padding or node spacing to increase negative space.

How it will be validated:

    Generate an infographic with mood: "calm" and one item marked with emphasis: "highlight".

    Verification 1: The output SVG code must contain the injected CSS variables and the texture filter definition.

    Verification 2: Visually inspect the rendered PNG (using a temporary save). The background should have a non-digital "grain" texture, and the highlighted item should be visually distinct from "normal" items through color or stroke weight.
