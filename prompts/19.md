Goal: Implement the SVG Composition logic to inject Base64 images and dynamic branding into the Hybrid templates.

    Template Loading: Update performGeneration to load the appropriate SVG template from public/assets/infographics/templates/ based on the blueprint.template_id.

    Base64 Injection:

        Use JSDOM to parse the template.

        Iterate through blueprint.items and find the corresponding <image id="slot_img_${i+1}">.

        Set the href (or xlink:href) attribute to the Base64 string: data:image/png;base64,[data].

    Branding & Text:

        Inject label_text into #slot_txt_${i+1}.

        Apply the blueprint.theme_color to any element in the SVG with the class .accent-color.

    Final Rendering:

        Send the composed SVG string to the Playwright BrowserService.

        Capture the 1024x1024 PNG and save it using LocalStorageService.

How this will be validated:

    Provide the agent with the hybrid_snake.svg source code (below) to save in the templates folder.

    Run a test for a 3-step process.

    Verification: Inspect the generated-images folder. The resulting PNG must show the AI-generated images perfectly clipped inside the SVG frames, with the text labels correctly positioned.
