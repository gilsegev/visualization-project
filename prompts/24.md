Goal: Run an end-to-end validation of the Hybrid Engine across two distinct scenarios to verify visual cohesion, layering, and full-bleed rendering.

Context: The system must use the refined snake_process.svg template which includes a #background_layer, a #connector_layer (the path), and foreground step_groups.

Task Instructions:

    Test 1: The Nature Scenario

        Input Prompt: "Create a 5-step sequential infographic on the Lifecycle of a Honeybee: Egg, Larva, Pupa, Adult, Pollination."

        Requirement: Gemini (Art Director) must define a "Macro Nature Photography" style. Silicon Flow must generate 5 bee-related icons and 1 blurred meadow background.

    Test 2: The Tech Scenario

        Input Prompt: "Create a 4-step horizontal journey of a startup: Idea, Funding, Build, Launch."

        Requirement: Gemini must define a "Minimalist 3D Isometric" style with a blue/teal theme. Silicon Flow must generate 4 tech icons and 1 abstract geometric background.

    Core Technical Audit (Apply to both):

        Z-Index: Ensure text labels and circles are strictly on top of the orange/accent connecting lines.

        Background: The AI background must fill the entire frame (preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice") and have a 40% white overlay for legibility.

        Full-Bleed: Verify the final PNG is exactly 1024x1024 with no white borders.

    Performance Check:

        Log the total time for each generation. The target for the entire pipeline is < 10 seconds.

How this will be validated:

    Visually inspect honeybee-lifecycle.png and startup-journey.png.

    Verification:

        Do the images in the "Bee" test look cohesive (same lighting/style)?

        Do the images in the "Startup" test look cohesive?

        Is the text perfectly legible and layered on the very top?

        Does the background fill the entire square?
