Update the classification and orchestration logic to handle animated vs. static charts:

    Router Update: In ImageRouterService, instruct Gemini to add a format: 'static' | 'animated' field to the data_viz payload.

        If 'animated', it will use the cinematic animations (duration 1500ms).

        If 'static', it will set animation: false in the spec.

    Strategy Logic: In DataVizStrategy, use this format to decide how to capture:

        If 'static': Perform a standard screenshot and save as task-{index}.png.

        If 'animated':

            Perform two captures: first, a screenshot of the 'final frame' (animation off) for the .png poster.

            Second, a Playwright video recording (recordVideo) of the full 2-second animation for the .mp4.

    Result Aggregation: Update ImageOrchestratorService to return a results object that can contain both a url and an optional posterUrl."
