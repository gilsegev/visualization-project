Goal: Refactor the InfographicStrategy to use the Canonical JSON Contract (v1) and integrate the Visual Systems Designer standard for SVG templates.

    Contract Update: In infographic.strategy.ts, replace the old InfographicBlueprint with the new nested structure:

        infographic: { intent: { narrative_type, explanation }, content: { title, subtitle, items }, visual_hints: { mood, complexity, density } }.

    Narrative Brain Upgrade: Update the generateBlueprint() system prompt to strictly request this new structure. Instruct the LLM to justify its narrative_type choice in the explanation field.

    Template Standard: Update the selectTemplate() logic to look for SVGs that follow the Designer LLM Standard. This means the strategy should expect templates in public/assets/infographics/templates/ to use:

        Classes: .step, .step-title, .step-detail, .icon-slot.

        IDs: title_n, desc_n, icon_n.

    Constraint Hardening: Implement logic to compare infographic.content.items.length against the metadata in templates.json. If a 4-step content is sent to a 3-step template, truncate and log a DEBUG warning.

    Documentation Update: Add the "Designer LLM Instruction" (provided in the chat) as a comment at the top of the strategy or in a new TEMPLATES_README.md so future templates are built correctly.

How it will be validated:

    Validation 1: Run test-infographic.ts. Verify the console log shows the new nested JSON structure (intent, content, etc.).

    Validation 2: Provide a mock "Journey" with 10 items. Verify the logs show a truncation warning because the journey.svg (max 7) cannot fit them.
