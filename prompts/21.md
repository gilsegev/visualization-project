Goal: Refine the Hybrid Engine to handle layer depth, thematic backgrounds, and responsive scaling.

    Atmospheric Backgrounds:

        Update InfographicStrategy to trigger one additional Silicon Flow request for a background.

        Prompt: blueprint.global_style_prompt + ", abstract minimalist background texture, out of focus, subtle colors."

        Inject this into a new <image id="background_layer" x="0" y="0" width="100%" height="100%" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice" /> at the very top of the SVG (behind everything).

    Z-Index Correction:

        In renderComposition, ensure the "Connectors" (the paths/lines) are injected before the "Step Groups" (the circles and text). This ensures lines stay behind the content.

    Responsive Scaling:

        Update the BrowserService call to ensure the SVG is rendered at 1024x1024 (or the aspect ratio of the template) with no margins.

    Thematic Labeling:

        Instead of pure #333 black text, have the "Art Director" provide a text_color that contrasts with the theme_color for better harmony.

How this will be validated:

    Re-run the Honeybee Lifecycle test.

    Verification 1: The background should no longer be white but a subtle, blurred "Nature/Meadow" texture.

    Verification 2: The orange snake line should visibly pass underneath the bee circles, not over them.

    Verification 3: The image should fill the entire 1024x1024 frame with no white borders.
