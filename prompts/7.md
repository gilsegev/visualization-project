"Implement the final asset types and apply production-grade network and performance hardening.

    Network Hardening (SiliconFlow Fix):

        In VisualConceptStrategy, implement a Persistent HTTP Agent for Axios (keepAlive: true). This reuses sockets and prevents the 'Socket Hangup' errors.

        Segregated Concurrency: Implement a local p-limit(8) inside VisualConceptStrategy. This ensures that while 15 tasks run globally, only 8 hit the external API at once.

        Add a 45-second timeout and a single retry attempt for 429 or network errors.

    Math Formula Strategy (MathJax):

        Implement real rendering in MathFormulaStrategy.

        Use the Playwright Singleton to render the LaTeX payload. Center the formula in the 1024x1024 frame with a clean white background and high-contrast black text.

    Beautify Slide Strategy:

        Create a professional HTML/CSS template for educational slides (e.g., modern typography, subtle gradient background).

        Inject the title and content from the task payload and capture a 1024x1024 screenshot.

    Peak Performance & Stability:

        Local Assets: Download the VisActor and MathJax JS bundles to public/assets/. Use page.addScriptTag({ path: '...' }) instead of CDN links to eliminate 'White Chart' issues caused by network lag.

        Global Concurrency: Increase the p-limit in ImageOrchestratorService to 15.

        Browser Pre-warming: Ensure the Playwright browser launches during the onModuleInit lifecycle hook so the first request is instant.

        Classification Layer: Ensure ImageRouterService is using Gemini 2.0 Flash for maximum classification speed."
