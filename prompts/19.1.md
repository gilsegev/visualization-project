Goal: Fix the critical bug in renderComposition where only the first item is injected into the SVG.

    Locate Code: In infographic.strategy.ts, find the section inside renderComposition commented as // Inject images and text items.

    Implement Loop: Replace the hardcoded access to blueprint.items[0] with a loop that iterates through the entire blueprint.items array.

    Dynamic Targeting: Inside the loop, use the index i to dynamically target the corresponding slots:

        document.getElementById('slot_img_' + (i + 1))

        document.getElementById('slot_txt_' + (i + 1))

    Safety Check: Ensure the code checks if the slots exist before trying to set attributes (to handle blueprints with fewer items than SVG slots).

How it will be validated:

    Run the existing test-hybrid-rendering.js (which likely has a multi-item blueprint).

    Verification: Open the resulting PNG. You should now see images and text injected into slots 1, 2, 3, etc., corresponding to the number of items in your test blueprint, instead of just the first slot.
