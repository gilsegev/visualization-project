Context: We are evolving the InfographicStrategy to use Gemini 2.0 Flash as a visual "Art Director." Instead of simple text extraction, the LLM will now design a cohesive visual blueprint.

Goal: Implement the Blueprint Generation logic using Gemini 2.0 Flash.

    Model Configuration: Update the InfographicStrategy constructor to initialize Gemini 2.0 Flash.

    The Art Director Prompt: Create a system prompt that instructs the LLM to output a strictly structured JSON blueprint:

        template_id: (snake_process | hub_spoke | vertical_stack).

        theme_color: A primary hex code for SVG accents.

        global_style_prompt: A 20-word "style glue" string (e.g., "minimalist 3D isometric, clay texture, soft lighting, professional matte white background") to ensure all generated images are cohesive.

        items: An array of N objects, each containing a subject_prompt (specific to that step) and label_text.

    Cohesion Logic: The LLM must ensure the subject_prompts are short and focus only on the object (e.g., "a simple golden honeybee egg"), as they will be appended to the global_style_prompt.

How this will be validated:

    Trigger a generation for "The 5 stages of a rocket launch."

    Verification: Check the console logs. The output must be a valid JSON blueprint where all 5 items share the same global_style_prompt but have distinct subject_prompts.
