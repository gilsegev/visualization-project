Goal: Fix the lingering aesthetic gaps in the Hybrid Engine: text layering, background cohesion, and full-page scaling.

    Strict Z-Index Layering:

        In renderComposition, you must explicitly reorder the SVG children.

        The Order: background_layer (Bottom) -> connector_layer (Lines) -> step_groups (Circles/Images) -> text_labels (Top).

        The Fix: Ensure all #slot_txt_n elements are moved to a separate <g id="labels_foreground"> at the very end of the SVG root to guarantee they are never obscured by lines.

    Thematic Background Integration:

        The background is currently too "busy" or disconnected. Update the InfographicStrategy to refine the background prompt.

        New Background Logic: Take the blueprint.global_style_prompt and prepend: "Extremely minimalist, soft bokeh, out-of-focus background texture, no sharp objects, colors matching [theme_color]..."

        Opacity Mask: Programmatically add a <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="white" opacity="0.4" /> immediately on top of the background image to "wash it out" and ensure the infographic content remains the focus.

    Full-Bleed Scaling Fix:

        SVG Root: Set width="100%" and height="100%" and ensure the viewBox is set to exactly 0 0 620 1580 (matching our template).

        Playwright Capture: In the BrowserService (or where the screenshot is called), set the viewport to 1024x1024 but tell Playwright to clip or scale the content so it fills the square without leaving white bars at the top or bottom.

        Instruction: If the content is vertical, center it horizontally in the 1024x1024 frame and let the background image (using preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice") bleed to the edges.

How this will be validated:

    Re-run the Honeybee Lifecycle test.

    Verification 1: Can you read the text clearly over the lines? (Text must be on top).

    Verification 2: Does the background feel like it belongs to the same "world" as the bees? (Color harmony check).

    Verification 3: Does the final PNG cover every pixel of the 1024x1024 area? (No white letterboxing).
