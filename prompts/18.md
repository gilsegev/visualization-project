Goal: Implement parallel image generation using Silicon Flow and integrate it into the InfographicStrategy pipeline.

    Service Setup: Within InfographicStrategy, implement a private generateImages method that receives the InfographicBlueprint.

    Parallel Execution:

        Use Promise.all to trigger N simultaneous requests to the Silicon Flow API.

        Target Model: Use flux-schnell or pro-mecha (whichever is configured for your Silicon Flow endpoint).

        Target Size: 512x512 (optimal for infographic icons).

    Dynamic Prompting: Construct each Silicon Flow prompt by concatenating the blueprint's global_style_prompt with the individual item's subject_prompt.

        Example: "minimalist 3D isometric... + a single server tower with blue LEDs."

    Buffer to Base64: Capture the image output as a Buffer and convert it to a Base64 string: data:image/png;base64,[data].

    Blueprint Enrichment: Update the blueprint.items array to include these Base64 strings in a new image_data field for each item.

How it will be validated:

    Update the test script to log the size and the first 50 characters of the image_data for each item.

    Verification: Total execution for a 5-item set must complete in < 5 seconds. The logs must show N successful parallel requests to the Silicon Flow API.
