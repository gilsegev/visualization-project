Goal: Transform the Infographic Engine from a "Diagram Filler" to a "High-Fidelity Scene Compositor."

    The "Full-Bleed" Layout:

        Update renderComposition to ensure the root <svg> uses width="100%" and height="100%" with preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice".

        Force the Playwright screenshot to a high-density 2048x2048 viewport to capture every detail of the AI icons.

    Thematic Background Integration:

        The Backdrop Call: Trigger a Silicon Flow request for a background using: blueprint.global_style_prompt + ", minimalist abstract bokeh texture, cinematic lighting, out of focus, no objects, harmonious with [theme_color]."

        The Frost Overlay: In the SVG, immediately after the #background_layer, inject a <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="white" fill-opacity="0.3" /> to "wash out" the background, making foreground elements pop.

    Foreground Z-Indexing:

        Reorder the SVG DOM programmatically:

            background_layer (Bottom)

            connector_layer (Lines)

            step_groups (Circles/Images)

            label_layer (Text - Top)

        Glassmorphism: Wrap each #slot_txt_n in a <g> that includes a semi-transparent, rounded <rect> (blur filter optional) behind the text to act as a "text anchor."

    Scaling the Assets:

        Increase the circular mask radius for #slot_img_n to at least 25% of the total width.

        Update the Art Director (Gemini) prompt to specify: "Ensure labels are punchy (max 3 words) to maintain a clean, high-end design."

How this will be validated:

    Re-run the Honeybee Lifecycle test.

    Success Criteria:

        The background is a beautiful, blurred texture that matches the bees.

        The orange connecting lines pass behind the circles.

        The text is sharp, sitting on top of everything, and is perfectly readable.

        There is zero white space on the edges of the 2048px render.
