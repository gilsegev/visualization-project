You are a Principal Data Visualization Engineer. We need to fix the blank chart issue while maintaining the 'Cinematic' aesthetic.

    Rendering Lifecycle (The Fix):

        In DataVizStrategy, if animation: true is requested, you MUST update the Playwright wait time to animationDuration + 500ms.

        Alternatively, for static screenshots, inject animation: false into the spec at runtime to ensure the 'Final State' is captured instantly.

    Harden the Spec Logic:

        Funnel/Pie Guard: Ensure the AI never generates axes for these types (prevents the getYAxisHelper crash).

        Neon Glows: Use shadowBlur: 15 and shadowColor only on the 'marks' (bars/lines), not the entire canvas.

    Moving Chart Option (Video):

        Update DataVizStrategy to support a format: 'video' parameter.

        If 'video' is requested, use Playwright’s browserContext({ recordVideo: { dir: 'videos/' } }).

        Allow the page to run for the full 2000ms duration, then save the resulting .webm or .mp4.

    Local Asset Injection:

        Stop using the CDN. Use the local vchart.js from public/assets/ to ensure the renderer starts immediately."
