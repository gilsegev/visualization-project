Goal: Implement the "Brain" that classifies the user's intent.

    Instruction for Agent:
    "Create an ImageRouterService that uses @google/generative-ai (Gemini).

        Implement a method classify(content: string): Promise<ImageTask[]>.

        Use the following System Instruction: [Insert the 'Logic Layer' prompt from our previous discussion].

        Ensure the service uses the Zod schema from Prompt 1 to parse the LLM's response. If the LLM returns invalid JSON, the service should throw a InternalServerErrorException."
